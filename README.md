# Document PDF Generator

https://lijazilla.github.io/document-pdf/build

Welcome to the Document PDF Generator, an application that allows you to create custom PDF reports directly from your web browser. This versatile tool enables you to add a logo, date, title, text, select up to three images for your project, provide image descriptions, and include contact information. Once your document is ready, you can download it as a PDF.

## Project Overview

This project was developed using JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, and leverages the ReactPDF library for PDF generation. It also uses the `saveAs` function from the `file-saver` library to enable PDF downloads. The application is hosted on GitHub Pages, making it accessible through a web browser.

5. Optionally, click the "Preview" button to review your document.
6. Finally, click the "Download PDF" button to obtain your customized PDF report.

There is no need to install anything; you can access the tool directly on GitHub Pages.
